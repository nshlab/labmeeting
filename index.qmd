: We will meet biweekly **on Mondays**, 10:00AM-12:00PM, in HSPH 2-426.

In the Fall 2025 term, we will discuss topics in high-dimensional statistics
and statistical machine learning, with material drawn from the texts
@wainwright2019highdim and @hardt2022patterns (see details below). We will
continue along this theme in the Spring 2026 term.

- @wainwright2019highdim: Ch. 2 (tail and concentration bounds), 4
  (uniform laws of large numbers), 5 (metric entropy), 7 (sparse linear
  models), 9 (regularized M-estimators), 12 (RKHS, including kernel ridge
  regression), 13 (non-parametric least squares), 15 (minimax lower bounds)
- @hardt2022patterns: Ch. 3 (supervised learning), 4 (representation and
  features), 5 (optimization), 6 (generalization), 7 (deep learning), 11
  (sequential decision-making), 12 (reinforcement learning)
