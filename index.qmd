: Note: [We will meet ***weekly on Mondays, 3:00-05:00PM***.]{.underline}

This term, we will continue to discuss topics in statistical learning theory
and statistical machine learning, primarily drawing material from the text by
@bach2024learning, possibly to be supplemented by topics covered in others
[e.g., @bickel2015mathematical; @duchi2024statistics]. Note that we will switch
weekly between presentations of materials from the relevant texts and informal
research presentations that cover the relationship between topics most recently
discussed and ongoing projects in this group.

  methods), 8 (sparse methods), 9 (neural networks), 10 (ensemble learning),
  11 (from online learning to bandits), 12 (over-parametrized models)
- @bickel2015mathematical: Ch. 7 (tools for asymptotic analysis), 9 (inference
