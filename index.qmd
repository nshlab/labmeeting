: Note: [We will meet ***weekly on Mondays, 3:00-05:00PM***.]{.underline}

In the Spring 2026 term, we will continue to discuss topics in statistical
learning theory and statistical machine learning, with material to be drawn
from the texts @bach2024learning, @bickel2015mathematical, and
@duchi2024statistics (see details below).

- @bach2024learning: Ch. 1 (mathematical preliminaries), 2 (supervised
  learning), 3 (linear least-squares), 4 (empirical risk minimization), 5
  (optimization for machine learning), 6 (local averaging methods), 7 (kernel
  methods), 8 (sparse methods), 9 (neural networks), 10 (ensemble learning),
  11 (from online learning to bandits), 12 (over-parametrized models)
- @bickel2015mathematical: Ch. 7 (tools for asymptotic analysis), 9 (inference
  in semi-parametric models), 12 (prediction and machine learning)
- @duchi2024statistics: Ch. 2 (basics of information theory), 4 (concentration
  inequalities), 5 (generalization and stability), 8 (minimax lower bounds),
